Welcome on **{{ site.title }}** !

I decided to learn how to use ScrollMagic and figured I might not be the only one struggling with the little details and gotchas. *How about making a little course to teach people*, I thought. And here it is.

I'm not an expert, I have many things yet to learn but I figured putting my thoughts and experiments on here could help others learn what I now know, and myself articulate my ideas better.

So here it is, hope it helps, if you have any questions, feel free to ask me, create issues on the GitHub repo or anything else, I'll be happy to answer, my email, Twitter and GitHub accounts are at the bottom of this very page !
