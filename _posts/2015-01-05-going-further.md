# This is it friend

After those 6 lessons, we've covered the basics of ScrollMagic and GSAP and how they enable us to create enjoyable scroll-based animations in our web pages.

We've discovered Tweens, Pins, Staggered animations and so much more, remember the Yoyos ?

# What's left for you to discover

I feel like I've shown you all the tricks to create **90% of the animations you'll ever need to create**, without getting too technical and diving into more complex solutions, and I believe this is where this course should end.

There is a lot more to know about ScrollMagic and GSAP, but I'm sure by now you should be able to learn about them on your own if needed, do some research about the following topics if you feel adventurous :

* GSAP Timelines
* SVG Drawing animation
* Mobile support in ScrollMagic
* Horizontal scrolling with ScrollMagic
* Timing methods in GSAP
* *so much more...*

# What I'm up to now

Because there is more to say, that not everyone will need to learn about, I've decided to work on all those other topics in an ebook. Things get more technical, more complex, and only professional frontend developers should really need to learn about those, hopefully, if you're one of them you've enjoyed learning the basics will me and will see buying my upcoming ebook as an investment.

You can already go on the [Book's LeanPub page](https://leanpub.com/advancedparallaxscrolling) and get notified when it gets published.

## What to expect from the book

Like I said already, the book will dive into more complex topics, Timelines, SVG and such, but will also feature prettier examples, deconstructions of actual websites and exercises. While I hoped for this book to be an easy-to-follow introduction that would enable most to create great animations and parallax websites, I hope the book will help you become perfectly comfortable with even the most complex animations and scrolling scenarios you could imagine, knowing the ins and outs of both ScrollMagic and GSAP.

It will be updated progressively, with a *discount price while I'm writing it*, I'm hoping to get some feedback to make it as easy to follow while exhaustive, providing you the knowledge you need to be able to code anything you or your designer would come up with.

## Why a paid ebook

This course as given anyone access to the basics of both libraries, yet it covers most of the scroll-based animation needs I've seen online. The book will build up from this knowledge and dig much much deeper into more complex subjects from either libraries and how to make both work. It's *only* needed **for professionals**, I want it to be **useful for professionals**, I want to have **the resources to make it that way**.

If you don't want to pay for it, which I can understand, **remember that both GSAP and ScrollMagic have documentations**, what I intend to do is make the learning experience simpler, faster and provide you with outside tips and real-life examples so you can see how things really work in the wild.
